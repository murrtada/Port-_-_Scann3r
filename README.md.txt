# Port-_-_Scann3r

My First Experience Building a Port Scanner

This tool represents my first hands-on project in building a port scanner using Python.
I created it to strengthen my understanding of:

How sockets work

How multi-threading speeds up scanning

This project helped me move from theoretical understanding to real practical coding, and it’s just the beginning — future updates may include deeper scanning.

Port-_-_Scann3r is a lightweight and fast port-scanning tool written in **Python**.  
It allows you to scan open ports on a target domain or IP address. 
Designed for learners, researchers, and practical security testing.

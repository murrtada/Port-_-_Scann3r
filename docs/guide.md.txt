# Port-_-_Scann3r Guide

This guide explains how to use the Port-_-_Scann3r tool, its features, and some technical insights.

---

## 1. Overview

Port-_-_Scann3r is a Python-based port scanner designed for learning purposes.  
It scans open ports on a given target IP or domain, shows the service name.

---

## 2. Requirements

- Python 3.x
- (Windows)
- Internet connection for domain resolution

---

## 3. Running the Tool

1. Open terminal or command prompt.

2. Navigate to the project directory:

3. Run the scanner:

4. Enter a target domain or IP when prompted:

## 4. Features Explained

- **Multi-threaded scanning:** Uses multiple threads to scan ports faster.
- **Open port detection:** Detects if a port is open and prints its service.
- **Invalid domain handling:** Prompts the user again if the domain cannot be resolved.
- **Safe exit:** Press Ctrl+C to stop scanning without errors.

## 5. Extending the Tool

You can modify the following in `scanner.py`:

- **Port range:** Change `range(1, 1025)` to scan more or fewer ports.
- **Timeout:** Adjust `s.settimeout(0.5)` for slower/faster scanning.
- **Threads:** Modify sleep time in thread creation for console clarity.

---

## 6. Best Practices

- Scan only targets you own or have permission to scan.
- Avoid scanning very large port ranges on public servers to prevent detection.
- Combine this tool with other learning projects for better understanding of network security.

## 7. Learning Notes

Building this tool helps understand:

- How **sockets** work in Python
- Basics of **multi-threading**
- Handling user input and exceptions
- Structuring a small project for learning and sharing
